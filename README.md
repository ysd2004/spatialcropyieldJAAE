2 Getting started:
==================

Download the R-file from this repository into yoour working directory.

``` r
    ## In R
    download.file("https://raw.github.com/ysd2004/spatialcropyieldJAAE/main/regCode.R", "regCode.R")
```
In *regCode.R*, it is implementable to download the regression data and peform the regression results in Table 3 and Table S2. Modifying the regression codes, all regression results in Yun and Gramig (2021) are reproducible.
